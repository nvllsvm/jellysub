Although not a direct replacement, I've since moved onto syncing an Opus version
of my entire library to my devices using [harmonize](https://github.com/nvllsvm/harmonize)
and [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/).

Contact me if you're interested in maintaining this.

A shim to use Subsonic clients with Jellyfin

Jellysub is an HTTP service which sits between Subsonic-compatible clients and a
Jellyfin server.

## Compatibility
Clients tested with Jellysub:

| Client                                          | Notes                                |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| [Audinaut](https://github.com/nvllsvm/audinaut) | fully functional excluding playlists |


## Installation
Available in the following distribution channels:
- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvllsvm/jellysub)
- [PyPi (Python)](https://pypi.org/project/jellysub/)

## Running
The following environment variables may be used to configure Jellysub.

| Name                    | Description                                           |

Command line arguments may also be used. See `jellysub --help` for more information.
